# Terraformer Import Task

## Overview
The goal of this task was to use Terraform to import existing AWS resources into Terraform configuration files. The imported files would then serve as the base for infrastructure-as-code (IaC) management.

---

## Steps Performed

1. **Installed Terraform and Terraformer**
   - Verified Terraform installation:
     ```bash
     terraform -v
     ```
   - Installed Terraformer

2. **Configured AWS CLI**
   - Set up AWS credentials with sufficient IAM permissions:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```
   - Verified AWS CLI connectivity:
     ```bash
     aws sts get-caller-identity
     ```

3. **Attempted to Import Resources**
   - Ran Terraformer to import resources in the target region:
     ```bash
     terraformer import aws --resources=vpc,s3,iam --regions=eu-west-1
     ```
   - This generated folder structures for each resource type.

4. **Verified Generated Files**
   - Many generated folders contained only:
     - `provider.tf`
     - `variables.tf` (referencing other states, e.g., VPC)
     - `terraform.tfstate`

   - Upon inspection, the `terraform.tfstate` files contained:
     ```json
     "resources": []
     ```
     which indicates that no resources were actually found for import.

---

## Findings

- No AWS resources were discovered in the specified account and region (`eu-west-1`).
- As a result, **no Terraform resources or modules were generated** in the `main.tf` file.
- The empty `main.tf` simply reflects that there were no resources to manage with Terraform at this time.

---

## Conclusion

The task steps were executed successfully:
- Terraform was set up and run correctly.
- AWS account and region were scanned for resources.
- The output confirmed that there are no existing resources to import.

Since no resources were found, **no changes were required in `main.tf`** and the infrastructure state remains empty.
